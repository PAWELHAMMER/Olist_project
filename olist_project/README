This is Olist_project: an analysis of data provided by Olist, the largest department store on Brazilian marketplaces.
I set up the tables containing the data I used during the analysis, and then I used SQL to view some interesting trends and facts.

Note: I used only some of the provided data, as it was sufficient for the analysis.
