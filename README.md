# Portfolio
Hello! My name is Pawe≈Ç. I am a recent Genetics gradute. During my studies and internships, I fell in love with the concept of working with data. I started with analyzing only biological data, but now I aspire to expand my work also to the business field.

I am currently:
- learning more SQL and Python
- learning about Cloud computing
- perfecting my Github site (obviously!)

This repository performs the role of a portfolio, in which I will showcase my skills as a data analyst. I will add new files continuously.

If You have any comments or recommendations, please do not hesitate to let me know.
Thanks for reading this and I hope You will appreciate my work!
