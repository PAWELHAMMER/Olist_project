# Olist_project
This repository contains my personal project, which focuses on analyzing datasets generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. I grew a personal interest in it, as performing analysis on real commercial data seemed like a great way to work with commercial data.

Here's how the database is structured:
- firstly, I created the set of tables using PostgreSQL based on the schema (visualization made in PowerBI):

And here's what the tables look like:
# olist_products
![](images/products_table.png)

# olist_order_items
![](images/orders_items_table.png)

# olist_orders
![](images/orders_table.png)

# olist_order_payments
![](images/payments_table.png)

- secondly, I asked certain questions, which I later answered using SQL code. With these questions, I tried to emulate the real work environment of a data analyst working for Olist.
In the project_tables file, I entered only a fraction of the data into the tables, just to showcase their structure without entering an enormous amount of strings and numbers in them. Of course, in my analysis I used the entire dataset which can be found here:
